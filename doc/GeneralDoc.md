# Workflow

We will use the Scrum work methodology. This methodology is carried out through iterations called sprints. We will perform the Sprint Planning every 2 weeks and the Daily Scrums for 15 minutes every day. Also at the end of each sprint we will do the Sprint Review and Retrospective to analyze what we can improve and what challenges we face.

Similarly, we will have 3 main roles to carry out this development methodology:

Product Owner: This role is responsible for, among other things, ensuring clear communication about the product, defining acceptance criteria, and ensuring compliance.

Scrum Master: This role is responsible for ensuring a productive work environment for the team, must protect it from external influences, clear obstacles and ensure that the principles, aspects and processes of the Scrum methodology are followed.

Scrum Team: Consists of a group of people who work on the user stories in the sprint backlog to create the project deliverables.
