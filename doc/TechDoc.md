# Branching Strategics 
The branch strategy is based on The GitHub in wich there are 2 main branches: "main" and "develop". In the main we will have the code that will be released for the deployment, while the develop branch is where the pre-production codes will be sent.

Similarly, we have other branches to add features that do not interfere with these and for each use case and will start with the name of “feature/<FeatureName>”.
 
Take into account that there are other test branches since the repository was used for didactic methods
